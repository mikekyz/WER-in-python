My Name is Michael Kyazze.My research is titled: A Framework for designing Ambient
Assisted Living Services for Disabled Individuals. There are 650 million estimated people with disabilities worldwide. South Africa has an estimated disability prevalence rate of 7.5%, excluding psychosocial and neurological disabilities. This implies that over with over 2.8 million South Africans face the following difficulties: hearing, seeing, communication, walking/climbing stairs, remembering/concentrating and self-care (Statistics South Africa, 2011). The large number of individuals facing difficulties highlights the necessity of this research. One way of overcoming the challenges faced by the disabled is by employing personal assistants. However, the cost of employing a personal assistant on a 24 hour basis is beyond
the financial reach of most people. South Africa provides a care dependency grant to primary care givers (personal assistants) of children with disabilities who require permanent care but do not reside in state run institutions. In 2011, nearly 111,000 children received the grant,which was R1,200 per month (DWCPD and UNICEF, 2012; Western Cape.Gov, 2012). Such an amount may not be enough to cater for all the needs of disabled children, such as the provision of education assistive devices.
